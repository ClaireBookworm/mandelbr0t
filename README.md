# mandelbr0t

Feel free to change the canvas size -- anything more 100 by 100 will probably be too slow.

Click to zoom in, currently there is no zoom out so be careful where you click. If you click on the right place, you can go on forever, but if you click incorrectly, you'll be stuck forever.

Studies say that if you click ~30 times you'll reach a place no one has gone before, and you'll be a pioneering mathematician exploring the wild, wild lands of the mandelbrot.

I have a really cool video but it won't upload on github so :(
